# Self home maintaince during mild and moderate covid infection

##VIDEO SUBMISSION: https://youtu.be/n9OurTrbVAw
## Discription
we have seen that hospitals are facing immense problems due to shortage of beds. One of the reasons being patients reporting to hospitals even when they have mild or moderate cases.This is due to their fear of self maintaince or livelyhood when they are home alone and infected. The website that we built acts as a nurse for them.
There are steps involved in this:
First the user has to sign in by entering email-id and their aadhar number.
Ater successful login they can login and a service home page will be shown.
The page consists of services like catering, groceries, medical help and helpline numbers.
The website will sign off automatically after the period of 20 days to ensure only covid positive cases stays.
The authentication of the patient's report status will be varied by local muncipal coorperation's database.
This solution will not only support the patients at home but will also help hospitals to manage beds for people who are extremly in need.
